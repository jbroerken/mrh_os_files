/var/log/mrh/
*************
The /var/log/mrh/ directory is the default location to store log files 
written by the MRH platform. The directory stores normal operation logs 
and backtrace logs for crashes.

Normal logs files are named after the application which created them. 
Backtrace files are also named after their application, but start with 
the bt_* prefix.
